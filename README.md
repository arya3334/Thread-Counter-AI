### Project Description
ThreadCounter AI is a fun web app that uses Python and OpenCV to detect and count threads in images of torn or burnt cloth. Just upload a greyscale image, and the app analyzes it to estimate the number of stitches needed to repair the damage. Simple, smart, and creative!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We‚Äôre solving the ‚Äúserious crisis‚Äù of not knowing how many stitches it takes to fix a burnt or torn hole in your favorite dress‚Äîbecause obviously, guessing isn‚Äôt scientific enough! So, we built an AI to count threads and help you avoid overstitching or understitching in your emotional recovery journey from wardrobe damage.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We use AI + OpenCV magic to analyze a photo of your tragically torn dress. First, we convert it to grayscale (because colors are overrated), then detect the "wound" using edge detection. Our Python-powered brain counts the number of visible threads and says, ‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôll need around this many stitches to heal this heartbreak!‚Äù It's like a digital tailor with a dramatic flair‚Äîno needles required.
